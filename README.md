Code in IDL to generate Secret Santas for a group of people who don't want to get the same person as last year.

Inputs of names and emails required, and a request to list who they got last year.

NOTE: if they didn't participate last year, just say they got themselves and it will work fine.

Keyword SHOWME prints output.
Keyword DEMO performs a demonstration of the code working.
Keyword DEBUG prints all the steps for inspection.
